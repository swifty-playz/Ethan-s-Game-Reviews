      <h3>Persona5: The Phantom X</h3>
    </a>
    <p>
      Persona 5: The Phantom X is a story-rich, turn-based RPG that will blend social simulation with dungeon exploration in Tokyo, Japan.
      The players will assume the role of a new Phantom Thief.
      They will have to balance daily life activities, like school and building relationships, with nighttime missions in the Metaverse as a Phantom Thief.
      The game will introduce new characters and features, like rhythm-based mini-games and a PvE mode they call Velvet Trials.
      However, the game will incorporate gacha elements; nevertheless, it will retain the essence of the Persona franchise.
      This free-to-play game is set to release on June 26, 2025, for PC and mobile.
