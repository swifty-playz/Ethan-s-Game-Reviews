      <h3>Detroit: Become Human</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Detroit Become Human developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment on May 25, 2018 is a huge story based interactive-narrative game about future androids serving humans, yet having souls of their own.
      The game focuses on three main androids, Kara, Connor, and Markus.
      This game delves into the idea of moral choices, discrimination, racism, and the freedom of androids.
      It takes place in Detroit, Michigan in the year 2038.
      If you enjoy story based games, then I truly believe you will enjoy this game with all it has to offer.
      Their are many different endings you can get, so it keeps you engaged.
      To 100% the game, it will take one upto 50 hours! 50 hours of playing as an android in the future!
      Now that sounds amazing!
      10/10

    <h3>Last Light</h3>
    <p>This game man... is the greatest game of the decade!
      Last time I played a game as good as this was when I was playing Pokemon Ultra Moon on my Nintendo 3DS or Yakuza 6: The Song of Life on my PS4.
      The graphics are so retro and the art is so well done.
      The lore to the game is impeccable, couldn't of done it better myself.
      I highly recommend this game to everybody in the entire world... no... to everybody in the entire universe!<br>
      10/10

      <h3>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</h3>
    </a>
    <p>This game... WAS AMAZING!!!!
      I played this game nonstop to get platinum trophy on my PS4.
      To summarize the story part of the game, Kiryu Kazuma, who just spent some time in prison, returns to the Morning  Glory Orphanage in Okinawa to learn that Haruka Sawamura, his adopted daughter, has gone missing.
      The game leads him on a journey to find and save Haruka, while also dealing with the Saio Triad, Tojo Clan, Omi Alliance, Yomei Alliance, and the Korean Mafia.
      Yes, Kiryu had his hands full in this one for sure!
      The story though is utterly amazing, and the game has a lot of side content to do, like mini games and sub stories.
      The characters in the game were written well, and the voice acting was superb.
      The game is about 25 hours long for the main story, but if you want to 100% the game, it will take you about 60 hours.
      So their is a ton of content to do in this game!
      If you are a fan of any of the following then this game is for you: Yakuza games/gang-type games, Japanese culture, action, adventure, story-rich, open-world, sacrifice, honour, and family.<br>
      My personal favorite game ever!<br>
      Absolute 100/10!
