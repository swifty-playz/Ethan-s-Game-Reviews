    <p>Majority of the game is a fun game to play when your just sitting around and bored; however, multiple of the level designs make me regret ever purchasing this game.<br>

      <h3>Minecraft</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Minecraft originally developed by Markus "Notch" Persson in May 2009 is a open world voxel-based sandbox videogame.
      You can play survival where you gather resources, build, and fight mobs to survive.
      You can also play creative where you have unlimited resources to build whatever you want.
      I have been playing this game more than half of my life, and I still have yet to lose interest in it!
      That is because of the endless possibilities you can do in the game.
      And if you do end up getting bored of the base game, their are always servers, plugins, mods, resource packs, maps, etc to enjoy to enhance your gameplay.<br>
      Want a zombie apocalypse? Download a mod for that!<br>
      Want pokemon? Download a mod for that!<br>
      Want to explore space and planets? Download a mod for that!<br>
      Point is, this game is so versatile that you can play it for years and never get bored of it.
      I do not see this game dying out anytime soon!
      I highly recommend this game to everyone because it fits everyone for anything they want to do!<br>

      <h3>Yakuza 0</h3>
    </a>
    <p>The game Yakuza 0 developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and published by Sega is about two yakuza and their beginning steps into the way of yakuza life. 
      My initial expectations for the game were really high, as I have played other Yakuza games prior, and I am glad to say that this game hit my expectations, if not even better! 
      This game is placed in Japan in the area of Kamurocho and Sotenbori, and in both areas the player has many mini games to play and sub stories to complete once they have finished the main story or even during. 
      This leaves the player to have a lot of fun constantly when playing with something always to do. 
      The game's visuals, soundtrack, voice acting, and sound effects are all amazing. 
      The game's main story is about 30+ hours long, but I'd guess that for 100% achievement completion, it'll take around 100 hours to do so. 
      Overall, the story is immaculate, lots of the mini games are super fun, and the sub stories can be really entertaining; however, some of the mini games like "disco" are annoying to play with their mechanics and quickness to them in my opinion. 
      I give the game a score of 9/10, with only some mini games bothering me from giving a perfect score, and would totally recommend to anyone interested in games placed in Japan, story rich, and lots of action!<br>

      <h3>Yakuza 5 Remastered</h3>
    </a>
    <p>I just recently began playing this gamme, so this review won't be long, nor will it be finished.
      I will come back to this review once I finish the game to give my full opinion on this game.
      Let's begin with this, if you know this webpage and about me, then you know I love the Yakuza franchise.
      From Yakuza 0 to Yakuza Like a Dragon to Judgement. So upon playing this game I already had incredibily high expectations as I have yet to play a bad game.
      And so far, I am not disappointed!
      The game starts with Taichi Suzuki, also known as Kiryu Kazuma, the 4th chairman of the Tojo Clan, who is now retired and working as a taxi driver in Fukuoka.
      Just like every other Yakuza game, their is some sort of conflict happening relating to the Tojo Clan, and Kiryu is dragged into it.
      Although I am little in to this 21 chapter, 37 hour long game, I am enjoying highly!
      The game has the same great visuals, soundtrack, voice acting, and sound effects as the other Yakuza games.
      The game has a lot of mini games to play, and sub stories to complete, which is always a plus in my book.
      My favorite mini game is the taxi driving.
      I recommend this game to everyone, especially those that love Japanese culture, action, story rich, and open world games.
      This was more than I was anticipating to say about this game that I have yet to finish, but I'll return to finish it and give my full review.<br>
      10/10
