      <h3>Yakuza 0</h3>
    </a>
    <p>The game Yakuza 0 developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and published by Sega is about two yakuza and their beginning steps into the way of yakuza life. 
      My initial expectations for the game were really high, as I have played other Yakuza games prior, and I am glad to say that this game hit my expectations, if not even better! 
      This game is placed in Japan in the area of Kamurocho and Sotenbori, and in both areas the player has many mini games to play and sub stories to complete once they have finished the main story or even during. 
      This leaves the player to have a lot of fun constantly when playing with something always to do. 
      The game's visuals, soundtrack, voice acting, and sound effects are all amazing. 
      The game's main story is about 30+ hours long, but I'd guess that for 100% achievement completion, it'll take around 100 hours to do so. 
      Overall, the story is immaculate, lots of the mini games are super fun, and the sub stories can be really entertaining; however, some of the mini games like "disco" are annoying to play with their mechanics and quickness to them in my opinion. 
      I give the game a score of 9/10, with only some mini games bothering me from giving a perfect score, and would totally recommend to anyone interested in games placed in Japan, story rich, and lots of action!

      <h3>Minecraft</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Minecraft originally developed by Markus "Notch" Persson in May 2009 is a open world voxel-based sandbox videogame.
      You can play survival where you gather resources, build, and fight mobs to survive.
      You can also play creative where you have unlimited resources to build whatever you want.
      I have been playing this game more than half of my life, and I still have yet to lose interest in it!
      That is because of the endless possibilities you can do in the game.
      And if you do end up getting bored of the base game, their are always servers, plugins, mods, resource packs, maps, etc to enjoy to enhance your gameplay.<br>
      Want a zombie apocalypse? Download a mod for that!<br>
      Want pokemon? Download a mod for that!<br>
      Want to explore space and planets? Download a mod for that!<br>
      Point is, this game is so versatile that you can play it for years and never get bored of it.
      I do not see this game dying out anytime soon!
      I highly recommend this game to everyone because it fits everyone for anything they want to do!<br>
      10/10

    <p>Majority of the game is a fun game to play when your just sitting around and bored; however, multiple of the level designs make me regret ever purchasing this game.</p>
